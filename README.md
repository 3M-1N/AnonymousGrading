  - The users will be able to sign up/log in. all the accounts are going to be stored in a database and the passwords will be encrypted.
  
  - There will be the possibility of creating a professor account that will only be able to see all the projects and the grades, but not who graded them. The professor will be able to assign students to project teams.

will be able to provide a demonstration video for their project that will be automatically played on the project page.

  - The jury consists of 6 randomly chosen members. Only the members of the jury can add grades, and the grades can only be modified by their owners but only 
for a limited period of time. Once the members of the jury are selected
